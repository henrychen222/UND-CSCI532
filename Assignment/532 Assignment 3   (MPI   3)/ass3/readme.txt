1. Give permission to the scripts under the running directory
      sudo chmod +x *.sh
2. Compile validation (non-mpi) version code and mpi version code respectively
     ./compile_ass3.sh
     ./compile_ass3_valid.sh
3. Set running parameters
      set <height> <width> <v_slices> <h_slices> <time steps> in run_ass3.sh, several points need to notify:
          (1) "halo" is not counted in width and height. For example, --height 16 --width 16 is actually a 18*18 dimension, 
               because the program gives another 2 dimensions on height and width for saving constant heat source
               (put on each dimension side keeping a constant temperature).
          (2) The parameters of "--v_slice" and "--h_slice" must both be evenly divisible by the parameters of "--height" and "--width",
              and should also be consistent with the parameters after -np
      set <height> <width> <v_slices> <h_slices> <time steps> in run_ass3_valid.sh,
              This time halo should be counted in width and weight.
4. Start and run the scripts
      ./run_ass3.sh
      ./run_ass3_valid.sh
5. Check the generated files, one set of files generated by mpi version, another set of files is the corresponding non-mpi validation version.
   The results should be the same.
