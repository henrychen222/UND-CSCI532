TO RUN THIS PROJECT BY Wei Chen, EXECUTE FOLLOWING STEPS

A. BUILD this project using cmake wih clang & llvm installed in LINUX
    $ sudo apt-get install clang llvm
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    then we get execuable app named 'kmeas-nompi'

B. RUN this app with proper arguments like this:
    Put the test star files in ./build/stars under project path,
        i.e., stars-10.txt, stars-23.txt and stars-86.txt
    Run project as below:
    $ ./kmeans-nompi 3 ./stars/stars-10.txt ./stars/stars-23.txt ./stars/stars-86.txt
    the console print out the intermediate information contents:
        a) Number of star files read;
        b) Number of stars read;
        c) Number of stars wanted;
        e) Logs for stars loaded in memory, including star number, max/min value for X Y Z;
        f) Random centroids for Llody's Algorithm;
        g) Each iteration with delta SSE and new centroids updated;
        h) Algorithm output, including centroids with the number of star clustered and the percentage;
        i) Time elapsed in NON-MPI Llody's Algorithm
